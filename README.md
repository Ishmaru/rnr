#R-N-R


_Everything isn't like home.  If everything were like home, there would be no reason for leaving home._  
- Clark Griswold

Ever spent time thinking where to go for a weekend or weeks even?  The world is getting smaller and more connected with the advancement of web-based technology and we're constantly inundated with images of tropical paradises, wintry havens, vineyard getaways, or flashes of cosmopolitan appeal.  So many places, so little time.  What do you do?

Well,

RnR is an app that uses your Instagram account to decide how to spend your well-earned vacations.  Our group app uses Instagram's API to filter through the likes of many images that you've _red-hearted_ and curates some suggestions based on the results.

But it doesn't stop there:

RnR allows you to organize your vacation destination ideas into collections for your next and future vacation plans.

In addition, RnR gives you Google map directions to your saved locations so that you can see what sites might be nearby, where to visit when you're finally there, and maybe connect a couple of local destinations all into one stay.
